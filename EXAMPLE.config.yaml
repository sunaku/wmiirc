  #
  # Keep in mind that these event handlers block the
  # wmiirc event loop---meaning that no new events are
  # received and processed until the current one has been
  # fully handled.  So try to keep them short and quick.
  #
  # If your event handler needs to perform a
  # long-running operation, then be sure to
  # wrap that operation inside a Ruby thread.

  # A key sequence may contain ${...} expressions which

  #
  # For example, if the "control:keyboard" section was:
  #
  #   control:
  #     keyboard:
  #       foo: Mod4
  #       bar: y
  #
  # and the following key sequence was used:
  #
  #   ${foo}-${bar},${bar}
  #
  # then after ${...} expression replacement,
  # that key sequence would appear like this:
  #
  #   Mod4-y,y
